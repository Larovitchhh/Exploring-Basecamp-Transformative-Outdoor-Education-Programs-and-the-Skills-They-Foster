Basecamp refers to a variety of outdoor education programs, each tailored to its local context but unified by a commitment to fostering personal growth, community, and a deeper connection to the natural world. For example:Backyard Basecamp in Baltimore, founded by pediatric nurse Atiya Wells, focuses on reconnecting BIPOC communities to nature through neighborhood walks, youth camps, and garden education, addressing historical barriers to outdoor access.

Idaho BaseCamp emphasizes helping kids discover their "Inner BaseCamp," an internal compass built on core values like respect, courage, personal responsibility, and connection.

Basecamp Adventure Trust in Leeds, UK, offers a year-long curriculum for young people facing barriers, combining adventure therapy with psychological modalities to boost self-esteem and emotional resilience.

Base Camp (Baldersby Park, UK) operates in a private country park, delivering school visits, holiday camps, and afterschool programs that prioritize nature, nurture, and experiential learning.

While each Basecamp has its unique flavor, they all share a commitment to experiential learning, inclusivity, and leveraging the outdoors as a classroom for personal and social development.
